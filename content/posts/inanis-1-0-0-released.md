The first version of [Inanis](https://github.com/Tearth/Inanis), a brand new chess engine written in Rust, is finally out! I've tried to make it as much feature-complete as possible, so it's fully usable with any GUI supporting UCI protocol. If you find any bug, please [make an issue](https://github.com/Tearth/Inanis/issues) with possibly the most detailed description and steps to reproduce the problem, so I can investigate it.

**Strength**: 2750 Elo, **Link**: https://github.com/Tearth/Inanis/releases/tag/v1.0.0
